# Implementation of data structures

In this university project we will implement several data structures which will be later used to index data in a pertinent way.

1. Trie: for the autocomplete functionality
2. R-Tree: to index posts depending on their location
3. AVL Tree or Red Black Tree: for the indexing of posts
4. Hash table: to search for hashtags
5. Graph: to manage the relations between users
