# Implementation of data structures

In this university work we implement several structures used to be able to index the data in a pertinent way.

1. Trie for autocomplete functionality
2. R-Tree for the indexing of posts according to location
3. AVL Tree or Red black Tree: for the indexing of posts
4. Hash table: search for hashtags
5. Graph: for the relation between users
